&ensp;&ensp;At the beginning of the year, I was told that my peripheral vision is disappearing due to severe glaucoma. It was pretty despressing at first, but I had to do something to compensate for my decrease in vision. So I thought, "Hey, I should start typing without looking at the keyboard." And surely, this was a thing that I've been doing for almost my entire life! I can't believe I typed my thesis with my crappy typing skills as seen in the image above (No wonder it took forever).

&ensp;&ensp;So I started searching for a good website to learn touch typing and stumbled upon <a href="https://www.typingclub.com/">www.typingclub.com</a>, which starts you from the very beginning (remember home keys?) and keeps track of your stats. I've been practicing daily and seeing my progress from my nooby 16 word per minute (WPM) to 32, then 43 WPM kept me motivated to continue.

&ensp;&ensp;I finished all the lessons (over 600+). So I kept repeating the old lessons for more practice until I got bored of them. Typing the same things again and again isn't exactly exhilirating. And so to the interwebz I went. I found another website, which I am currently using for my daily practice: <a href="https://www.keyhero.com">www.keyhero.com</a>. The things you type vary greatly as it chooses from a pool of quotes made by the website and other users who submitted their own quotes.

&ensp;&ensp;The stats tracking isn't as detailed, but it is good enough to see my progress as I practiced again and again. I've been hovering around the higher 60s to the low 70s. Also, I'm not really sure how I got that 98.89 WPM. Maybe I was high on life at that time. Anyways, I feel like I should have learned touch typing years ago. All I really had to do was practice.
