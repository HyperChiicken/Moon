&ensp;&ensp;The end of the second of the gamejam is here and all I've been doing are art assets <b>[>__O]</b>. I underestimated the amount of time to learn Godot and making the assets themselves. Despite the hardship, I'm actually stoked that I am able to animate my sprites within Godot after an ungodly amount of time going through forum posts and tutorials.

&ensp;&ensp;I got a chicken punching going on there. Also a chick which is supposed to shoot LAZERS from its mouth and a rolling egg. I'd like to implement some actions for each character/sprite at least. There is still so much to do such as level desgin, scripting, and story segments. My brother, who's in charge of music, is MIA. So no music lol. 

&ensp;&ensp;Making a game is definitely a lot of work. No wonder solo devs take a long time to finish their games. They have to take care of all the design, coding, assets, marketing, etc. Props to the people who make games weekly. You guys are an awesome dedicated bunch! Anyways, one more day to go!
