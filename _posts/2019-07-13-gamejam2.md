&ensp;&ensp;The end of the second day of the gamejam is here and all I've been doing are art assets <b>[>__O]</b>. I underestimated the amount of time to learn Godot and making the assets themselves. Despite the hardship, I'm actually stoked that I am able to animate my sprites within Godot after an ungodly amount of time going through forum posts and tutorials. Here are the steps I had to do:

<ul>
  <li>Make the spritesheet and export it as a PNG (I use Autodesk Sketchbook on my old Samsung Tab Pro).</li>
  <li>Put the PNG file into the working project folder in Godot.</li>
  <li>Now, create a new node - a <b>KinematicBody2D</b> </li>
  <li>Select the asset on the Texture slot of the sprite node. Or just drag and drop it on the main window. Make sure the new node is a child of the <b>KinematicBody2D</b>.</li>
  <li>Click on the sprite node and select 'TextureRegion' then 'Snap Mode:' dropdown menu should be placed as 'Auto Slice'</li>
  <li>On the Inspector window, enable the checkbox that says 'Region.' This will show the sprite as an individual on your working window.</li>
  <li>To animate, create another child called 'AnimationPlayer' under the <b>KinematicBody2D</b> node. Click on the new 'AnimationPlayer' node and create a new animation by clicking <i>Animation</i>><i>New</i>  then name your new animation.</li>
  <li>Add a track by going to <i>Add track</i>><i>Property Track</i>><i>nameofyourspritenode</i>><i>region_rect</i></li> 
  <li>Set the update mode of the <i>region_rect</i> track to 'Discrete'</li>
    <li>Start inserting the sprite by clicking the sprite you want to place within the <b>TextureRegion</b> window and going back to the <b>Animation</b> window and right-clicking then pressing 'Insert Key' on the track. Rinse and repeat.
</ul>

&ensp;&ensp;I got a chicken punching going on there. Also a chick which is supposed to shoot LAZERS from its mouth and a rolling egg. I'd like to implement some actions for each character/sprite at least. There is still so much to do such as level desgin, scripting, and story segments. My brother, who's in charge of music, is MIA. So no music lol. 

&ensp;&ensp;Making a game is definitely a lot of work. No wonder solo devs take a long time to finish their games. They have to take care of all the design, coding, assets, marketing, etc. Props to the people who make games weekly. You guys are an awesome dedicated bunch! Anyways, one more day to go!
