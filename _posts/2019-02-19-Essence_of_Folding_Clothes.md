I never really got why I needed to fold my clothes. It didn't mind that my clothes are wrinkly because I'm sloppy like that. I can just grab anything I want from the pile like underwear if I needed it. "There should be one more," was my motto until there isn't. So ended up going commando that day. Instant enlightenment.
