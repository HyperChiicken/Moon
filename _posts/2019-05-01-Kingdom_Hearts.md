&ensp;After sitting in my backlog for a good few months, I was finally able to get into Kingdom Hearts 3. It was time again to visit the ol' Disney Worlds and their cringy stories. My only reprieve between these so called story fragments is the Gummi Ship! I've been spending hours customizing my badass ship, pewpew-ing with it, leveling it up, then customizing it further. Rinse and repeat!

&ensp;I'll get back to the main game some day.
