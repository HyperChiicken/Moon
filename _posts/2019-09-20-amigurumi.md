&ensp;&ensp;It's another one of those things I've been holding off doing, a Chicken Amigurumi. I've made an pug amigurmi for a gift back in the day and turned out cute in a weird way. Of course, I tried following instructions from several guides like Instructables and Youtube, but the end product still turned out different. So today, was the day I was going to make a legitimate amigurumi in the shape of a chicken. <b>SPOILER</b>: It still turned out weird. But yeah, the title and the descriptions should have given that away. The Chicken Amirgurumi I made be weird yo!
