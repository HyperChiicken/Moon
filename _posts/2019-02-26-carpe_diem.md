It's a weekday, no work and all alone. All the things I've been wanting to do rush through my head. I get excited. I finally get to work on some of my personal projects. Maybe marathon that anime series with the annoying naruto-like protagonist, put a dent on my eternal game backlog... or or or maybe even fold my clothes! Better yet, I'll do all of them! Seize the day!

Nope.

Imma sleep bro.
