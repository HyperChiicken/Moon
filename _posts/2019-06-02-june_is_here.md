&ensp;&ensp;May is gone and June has emerged. Looking back, things have "got done" I guess. But there is still a plethora of projects in my backlog. I'm itching to get them done, but motivation meter is definitely doing that Ultraman-flashing-warning-thing. And I still have half of the year to go!

<b>Graaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!</b> Time to play some games to replenish.
