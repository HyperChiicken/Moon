&ensp;&ensp;The gamejam ended at 10am of Sunday, 7/14/2019. I didn't get to submit my game, but there are a bunch of games other people have created that are worth checking out here: <a href="https://itch.io/jam/zero-words-gamejam-2/entries">https://itch.io/jam/zero-words-gamejam-2/entries</a>. Again, props to the people who were able to accomplish their goal! 

As for me, I learned a good amount about making sprites and animations. I'd like to build up on what I have done this jam and hopefully get something functional as my first Godot game. In other news, I got to mess around with Blender 2.80 and made my first weird looking chicken model. <b>Behold! :P</b>

&ensp;&ensp;Yeah, with a little imagination, it can be a chicken. My modeling skills definitely need some work, but it's fun to know that I can manipulate a single cube into something complex like this blob I call <b>ChickenThing</b>.
