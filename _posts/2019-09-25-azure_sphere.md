&ensp;&ensp;Microsoft and AVNET is giving away 20,000 Azure Sphere devices for everyone to test. It's basically a microcontroller with a secure IoT infrastructure revovling around certificate authentication. Hackster is running a contest on security using this device so I thought I'd play around with making my own stand-alone authenticator. The project is due at the end of next month so gotta start <b><i>making!</i></b>
