So. Much. Studying. I feel like the bulk of my life was spent on academia. You know, learning how to learn. I chose to pursue Electrical Engineering, which didn't feel quite right. So I went ahead and got my Master's degree on it just to make sure that it really isn't for me. As of today, I'm still not sure. But what I did find out is this: I love learning through projects, by making.
