## The Academic

So. Much. Studying. I feel like the bulk of my life was spent on academia. You know, learning how to learn. I chose to pursue Electrical Engineering, which didn't feel quite right. So I went ahead and got my Master's degree on it just to make sure that it really isn't for me. As of today, I'm still not sure. But what I did find out is this: I love learning through projects, by making.

It's rewarding to see one of your prototypes at work, but getting to that moment is painful. Building something from nothing literally takes a lot of time. The cycle of implementing and debugging until it works is frustrating at best. Yet I still push forward because every hurdle is a lesson waiting to be learned. And overcoming all the hurdles brings you to the goal of a (kindda) completed project.

## The Artist

I like cute and cool looking things. Someday I'd like to marry them together and have something like chibi chihuahuas wearing mecha armor. In the the meantime, I'm just drawing random doodles/comics as some sort of a weekly journal.
